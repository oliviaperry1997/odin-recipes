# odin-recipes

this is a TOP Project (and yes, i realize that reads as 'a the odin
project project'). in this lesson, i'll be using the basic html skills
that i've learned in order to make a basic recipe website. i've done a
fair amount of html coding on my own time, so this is mostly review for
me, but i have picked up a few new tricks, and i'm eager to put them to
use.
